# Roadmap

This roadmap reflects the project's direction based on recent development and community feedback. It is not a commitment — priorities may shift as the ecosystem evolves.

## Near-term

- **Additional transport backends** — Discord and Slack transports via the plugin system
- **Improved onboarding diagnostics** — expand `untether doctor` with network, permission, and engine health checks
- **Cost tracking enhancements** — historical cost reporting, per-project budgets, weekly summaries

## Mid-term

- **Web dashboard** — browser-based UI for monitoring active runs and session history
- **Multi-user support** — per-user permissions and session isolation in group chats
- **Agent orchestration** — chain multiple engines in a single workflow (e.g., Claude for planning, Codex for execution)

## Future

- **Self-hosted relay mode** — run the Telegram bridge on a remote server with secure tunnelling to local agents
- **Additional transports** — Matrix, WhatsApp, or other messaging platforms via the plugin system
- **Webhook-driven workflows** — trigger agent runs from CI/CD events, GitHub webhooks, or external services
